  <summary>See Patent Description</summary>
  the present invention is an innovative bib device for the protection of infants and their surroundings from the effects of spilled milk or formula during the act of nursing from a bottle . the bib comprises a substantially circular or oval - shaped cloth , either natural cloth , as terry cloth , or synthetic cloth , such as the material used in disposable diapers . hereafter it will be understood that the invention constructed with synthetic cloth is the preferred embodiment , in that it is disposable . the disposable materials of the current invention have been specially made for liquid absorption , such as paper or cotton batting or quilting materials . in its preferred embodiment , the bib material consists of several layers . for example , in a preferable mode , the invention comprises a three layer material consisting of an bottom layer 7 of lightweight lining , an inner layer 6 of a soft and absorbent cotton or synthetic batting or quilting covered by a top layer 5 of semi - permeable or directionally - permeable material that captures liquid in such a way that it is absorbed into the inner absorbent layer the surface of the material stays dry or nearly dry . the exact material and construction can vary , but it is essential that the material be absorbent and liquid - capturing . the bib further contains an opening ( substantially oval or circular in the preferred embodiment ), centered about halfway between the center of the bib and the top edge . ( of course , in the circular embodiment , all edges are equivalent .) the opening is surrounded by elastic material of sufficient strength to fit a full bottle of formula . the elastic is capable of fitting a bottle between 1½ and 2½ inches in diameter , the range of circular dimension of most infant bottles . the preferred embodiment is substantially flat , as portrayed in fig1 . it is designed to fit around the neck of an infant bottle inserted in the elastic - surrounded aperture of the bib . either face of the bib can face the infant ; preferably , the absorbent side 5 of the bib will face the infant . it is thus in position to catch and absorb any spilled or emitted liquid . dimensions 1 and 2 are not particularly critical , except that each must exceed dimension 3 by a substantial margin . in our best mode case , the bib is substantially oval or circular in shape , and dimensions a and b are approximately equal , and about 8 - 10 inches . dimension 4 , the maximum diameter of the aperture , is critical in that it must comfortably admit the bottom of an infant bottle , up to the neck , without being so large as not to secure it comfortably . dimension 3 is simply the width of the aperture plus the additional width taken up by the elastic material . these dimensions can vary slightly according to the application . we have found that a value of dimension 3 = 2¾ inches and dimension 4 = approximately 2½ inches is ideal for most applications . note that because of the elastic surrounding the aperture , dimension 4 can shrink to about 1½ inches . fig2 is the view of the surface of the bib 7 that faces away from the infant , showing the elastic collar . this collar is the preferred contact point for supporting the bottle . the bib from spilled liquid thus protects the feeder &# 39 ; s hand , and is firmly supported thereby . a convenient method of properly placing the bib onto the bottle is to place the bib on a flat surface , opposing side down . then stand the bottle atop the bib , over the aperture , and slide the bib up until it surrounds the neck of the bottle . by this method , the bib is placed at the correct location , in the proper orientation , with the correct surface facing the infant , and the elastic collar 8 properly situated for fitting on the bottle . while this device is primarily intended for use in the home , it can equally well be used in a hospital , nursery , or other institution of infant and childcare . in this service , the current invention can also serve to help monitor liquid uptake by the infant , a critical parameter often used by doctors and child care professionals . thus , as the current invention is efficient in capturing spilled liquid , the practitioner can weigh the bib before and after feeding the infant , and calculate the amount of spilled formula or liquid by difference . this calculated amount is then subtracted from the measured amount of liquid dispensed from the bottle . the result of this calculation is the amount of liquid actually consumed by the infant , calculated to a much more precise degree than is achieved by current methods . yet another embodiment of the current invention is the open collar bib displayed in fig4 . this bib has velcro ™ or similar fasteners on the upper side of the tip of the left hand collar 9 , and on the underside of the tip of the right hand collar 10 . ( of course , the locations of the fasteners could be reversed , or otherwise slightly changed , without fundamentally affecting the invention .) when the two fasteners are contacted and fastened to each other , the bib can be snugly fitted around a bottle in the same fashion as the bib of the preferred embodiment . this embodiment has the advantage of being washable after use , and thus reusable . a larger version of this bib embodiment can be easily converted for use as an infant bib . while the present invention has been described in terms of several preferred embodiments , it is not intended to limit the invention to the particular forms set forth . on the contrary , the present invention is intended to cover such alternatives , alterations , modifications , and equivalent structures and devices as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined within the appended claims .

  <summary>See Patent Description</summary>
  reference is first made to fig1 , in which is illustrated a medical implantable lead according to the invention in a perspective view . the lead ( lead body ) includes a connecting structure 1 in a proximal end for connection to e . g . a pacemaker or the like ( not shown ), an intermediate flexible lead part 2 , and a so called header 3 in a distal end . the header is provided with a helix 4 , which can be screwed out in the axial direction of the lead from a cavity in the distal end of the header . the helix has the function of attaching the distal end of the lead to the heart , by being screwed into the tissue , and also functions as an electrode for receiving and / or transmitting electrical signals from and to the tissue , respectively . the header is also provided with a second electrode , a so called indifferent electrode 5 , which is formed as a ring and positioned a small distance from the distal end and has the purpose of forming a complete current path together with the helix . the proximal and the distal ends of the lead according to fig1 are illustrated in an enlarged scale in the shortened representation of the lead in fig2 . the helix 4 for fixation of the distal end of the lead to tissue as well as for function as an electrode is shown in an extended state . however , during insertion of the lead into a body , the helix is preferably retracted into the bore of the header 3 having a tubular shape in the distal end . in addition to a tip electrode in form of the helix , which is adapted to be screwed into the tissue , the lead comprises , as is mentioned above , a second electrode in form of the ring electrode 5 on a short distance from the distal end . in the proximal end , the connecting structure 1 for connection to a not shown monitoring and / or controlling device comprises first and second sealing members 6 of an elastic material , in order to achieve a fluid tight connection to a socket recess of the monitoring and / or controlling device . in the area between the sealing members , the lead is provided with first 7 and second 7 ′ electrically conducting connectors , which are adapted to be electrically coupled to mating connectors inside the monitoring and / or controlling device . the first connector 7 , i . e . the most proximal connector , is in electrical contact with the helix 4 , whereas the second connector 7 ′ is in electrical contact with the ring electrode 5 by means of one or more electrically conducting coils inside the lead , as is to be explained more in detail below . in the most proximal end , the lead is provided with a rotatable pin 8 by means of which the helix 4 can be rotated and screwed out from the bore inside the header 3 and into the tissue . now reference is made to fig3 and 4 , in which are illustrated a first embodiment of the flexible lead part 2 in a longitudinal section as well as a cross section through the lead , respectively . the lead has an inner tubular torque transferring member 9 , an inner fluid tight tubing 10 , an electrically conducting coil 11 and an outer fluid tight tubing 12 . the inner tubular torque transferring member is rotatable arranged inside the inner tubing and is formed as a coil of five comparatively thick and rigid helical wires of e . g . metal or polymer , such that it is well suited for transferring of a torque from the proximal to the distal end of the lead . moreover , the torque transferring member 9 defines an inner bore 13 for the purpose of allowing insertion of a guide wire or the like for guiding the tip of the lead to a desired position inside a body . the electrically conducting coil 11 is composed of two separate , co - radially wound wires 14 , 14 ′, each having an electrically conducting core 15 and a surrounding electrically insulating layer 16 , such that they form two electrically separated inductance coils . with reference also to fig2 , it is to be understood that the structure of the flexible lead part 2 as illustrated in fig3 and 4 , extends from the connecting structure 1 in the proximal end to the header 3 in the distal end . moreover , the tubular torque transferring member 9 is in its proximal end mechanically connected to the rotatable pin 8 and in its distal end mechanically connected to the helix 4 , such that by rotating the rotatable pin it is possible to rotate the helix and extend it out from the inner bore of the header and screw it into the tissue . one of the wires in the electrically conducting coil 11 is in its proximal end electrically connected to the first connector 7 and in its distal end electrically connected to the helix 4 , whereas the other wire in the electrically conducting coil is in its proximal end electrically connected to the second connector 7 ′ and in its distal end electrically connected to the ring electrode 5 . reference is then made to fig5 and 6 , in which are illustrated a second embodiment of the flexible lead part 2 in a longitudinal section as well as a cross section through the lead , respectively . as in the first embodiment according to fig3 and 4 , this embodiment comprises an inner tubular torque transferring member 9 , formed of five helical wires in a similar way as in the first embodiment , and an inner fluid tight tubing 10 . however , this embodiment includes two separate electrically conducting coils , one inner 17 and one outer 17 ′, separated by an intermediate fluid tight tubing 18 . each of the electrically conducting coils is formed of one single wire 14 , 14 ′ having an electrically conducting core 15 and a surrounding electrically insulating layer 16 , such that they form two coaxially arranged inductance coils . also this embodiment comprises an outer fluid tight tubing 12 . as in the first embodiment , the tubular torque transferring member 9 is in its proximal end mechanically connected to the rotatable pin 8 and in its distal end mechanically connected to the helix 4 , such that by rotating the rotatable pin it is possible to rotate the helix and extend it out from the inner bore of the header and screw it into the tissue . the inner electrically conducting coil 17 is in its proximal end electrically connected to the first connector 7 and in its distal end electrically connected to the helix 4 , whereas the outer electrically conducting coil 17 ′ is in its proximal end electrically connected to the second connector 7 ′ and in its distal end electrically connected to the ring electrode 5 . reference is then made to fig7 and 8 of the drawings , in which is illustrated a first embodiment of a connection of the electrically conducting wires 14 , 14 ′ to the electrodes as well as the tubular torque transferring member 9 to the helix 4 . fig7 and 8 are longitudinal sections through the distal portion of a medical implantable lead , according to the embodiment as illustrated and described in relation to fig3 and 4 , with the helix being retracted and extended , respectively . the longitudinal sections of fig7 and 8 are taken at the joint between the header 3 , as seen to the right , and the distal end portion of the flexible lead part 2 as illustrated in fig3 and 4 . the header is made of a rigid material such as metal or a polymer and is formed with an inner bore 19 , in which the helix 4 is rotatably and displaceably accommodated . in the joint region between the header and flexible lead part , the electrically conducting ring electrode 5 is provided , which also functions as a joint connector in that it comprises a distal shoulder surface , in which the proximal end of the header 3 is located and attached , and a proximal shoulder surface in which the distal end of the flexible lead part 2 is located and attached . at a short distance toward the distal end from the ring electrode 5 , the lead is provided with a fixed support member 20 . both the ring electrode 5 and the support member 20 are formed with a through bore , through which a shaft 21 is rotatably and displaceably inserted , in the distal end of which the helix 4 is mounted . the shaft 21 is of an electrically conducting material and to prevent electrical connection between the shaft 21 and the ring electrode 5 as well as the support member 20 , in case it is manufactured of an electrically conducting material , electrically insulating shaft bushings 22 are arranged in each of the through bores . to allow rotation and displacing of the helix 4 out from and into the inner bore 19 of the header , the tubular torque transmitting member is mechanically connected to the proximal end of the shaft . in case the tubular torque transferring member 9 is of an electrically conducting material , it may be advisable to arrange the connection in an electrically non - conducting fashion , such as via an electrically insulating sleeve 23 or the like . the electrically conducting coil of the lead comprises two electrically conducting wires 14 , 14 ′, which are electrically insulated from each other . to accomplish electrical connection to each of the ring electrode 5 and the helix 4 , one of the electrical conducting wires 14 ′ is electrically connected to the ring electrode 5 , whereas the other electrically conducting wire 14 is electrically connected to a sliding contact 24 arranged on the support member 20 , the sliding contact being in permanent electrically contact with the shaft 21 , which is in electrically contact with the helix 4 . in this way an electrical connection is ensured with the helix in spite of the fact that the tubular torque transferring member 9 is not electrically conducting and irrespective of the rotated and extended position of the helix . reference is then made to fig9 to 11 in which is illustrated a second embodiment of a connection of the wires 14 of the electrically conducting coil 11 to the helix 4 . fig9 and 10 are perspective views of the inner parts of the lead whereas fig1 is a cut through perspective view showing also the header 3 and the outer fluid tight tubing 12 . as is best seen in fig1 , the lead is provided with a none rotating coupling 25 of an electrically conducting material which is formed with a through bore . a shaft carrying the helix is rotatable and displaceable mounted inside the through bore . moreover , the shaft is composed of two different parts , i . e . a proximal part 26 of an electrically insulating material and a distal part 27 of an electrically conducting material . the coupling 25 is forming an annular shoulder surface 28 facing in the distal direction , whereas the distal part of the shaft is forming an annular shoulder surface 29 facing in the proximal direction . in a space formed between the shoulder surfaces of the coupling and the shaft , a wire assembly 30 of helically wound wires 31 is mounted . the wire assembly is composed of four electrically insulated wires which are attached at each end to an annular washer 32 and the wires are wound in counter clockwise direction around the axis of the shaft 26 , 27 . the annular washers are galvanically attached to the coupling 25 and the distal part 27 of the shaft , respectively , e . g . by means of welding or the like . when the helix 4 is retracted into the header 3 , as in fig9 and 11 , the wires 31 of the wire assembly 30 are each wound about five turns in the counter clockwise direction . when the helix subsequently is extended out from the header by being rotated in the clockwise direction , as in fig1 , the wire assembly 30 will be twisted in the clockwise direction such that the wires 31 in the wire assembly will simultaneously be unwound . accordingly , the diameter reduction of the wire assembly due to the extending of the helix 4 will be counteracted by a diameter increment due to unwinding of the wires of the wire assembly . in fig1 is illustrated an alternative embodiment of the wire assembly 30 . also here the wire assembly is composed of four electrically insulated and conducting wires 31 , which each are attached with their ends to an annular washer 32 , respectively . however , in this embodiment the wires are not helically wound around an axis of the wire assembly but each wire only around itself such that the four helically wound wires will be parallel to each other when mounted in the lead . when extending the helix by rotation , each helical wire will be extended by stretching out the helical winding . it is to be understood that the wire assembly can be formed also in many other ways than has been described and illustrated herein . for example , the wire assembly may be composed of only one or any other arbitrary number of electrical wires . moreover , it is not absolutely necessary that the wire assembly comprises two annular washers in which the ends of the wires are attached . instead , the wire ends could be attached directly to the coupling and the shaft , respectively . also , it would be possible to use uninsulated wires instead of insulated if it is ensured that the wires will not come into contact with other electrically conducting parts of the lead , such as an electrically conducting header sleeve or the like . however , an electrically insulated helically wound wire is also advantageous for preventing induction of current from an electromagnetic field into the wire , as is described hereinbefore . although modifications and changes may be suggested by those skilled in the art , it is the intention of the inventors to embody within the patent warranted heron all changes and modifications as reasonably and properly come within the scope of their contribution to the art

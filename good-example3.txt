described structure while taking as an example a case where the data of the memory cell ( mc1 ) 74 is read out . note that , an explanation for the writing / erasing operation is omitted here . first , before the read out operation , the respective signal levels are set as follows and retained in a stand - by state . namely , by the not illustrated control system , the first and second switch signals psw 1 and psw 2 are set to a high level , and the third and fourth switch signals ssw 1 and ssw 2 are set to a low level . moreover also the levels of word line ( wl ) 73 and signal ssa are set at a low level . as a result , the nmos transistors ( nt sw1 ) 66 and ( nt sw2 ) 67 in the bit line voltage adjustment circuit ( bva ) 50 become the on state , and the nmos transistors ( nt sw3 ) 68 and ( nt sw4 ) 69 and nmos transistors ( nt 1 ) 76 and ( nt 2 ) 71 become the off state . by this , a first voltage v p1 is supplied to the bit line ( bl ) 71 and inverted bit line ( bl -- ) 72 , and the potential is retained at the ( v cc / 2 ) level . where the read out operation is started from the above stand - by state , the first switch signal psw 1 is set at the low level and the third switch signal ssw 1 is set at the high level . by this , the nmos transistor ( nt sw1 ) 66 becomes the off state , and the nmos transistor ( nt sw3 ) 68 becomes the on state . as a result , the supply of the first voltage v p1 to the bit line ( bl ) 71 is stopped , and the supply of the second voltage v p2 is started . namely , the charging of the voltage v bl of the bit line ( bl ) 71 to the voltage v p2 is started . at this time , the supply of the first voltage v p1 is continued to the inverted bit line ( bl -- ) 72 , and the potential is retained at the ( v cc / 2 ) level . usually , v p2 = v p1 - 0 . 2 to 0 . 5v . next , the word line ( wl ) 73 is set at the high level . subsequently , after an elapse of a predetermined time , for example , 5 to 20 ns , from when the word line ( wl ) 73 is set at the high level , the third switch signal ssw 1 is set at the low level . by this , the nmos transistor ( nt sw3 ) 68 becomes the off state , and the supply of the second voltage v p2 to the bit line ( bl ) 71 is stopped . if the memory cell ( mc1 ) 74 passes a current in this state for a predetermined time , for example , 5 to 20 ns , for the time for which v bl & lt ; v p1 stands , it enters a waiting state . after the elapse of this time , where the memory cell ( mc1 ) 74 passes a current , v bl & lt ; v p1 stands , while where it does not pass a current , v bl = v p2 stands . on the other hand , the voltage v bl -- of the inverted bit line ( bl -- ) 72 is connected to the first voltage supply line ( v l1 ) 59 during this time , and therefore the potential is retained at the first voltage v p1 irrespective of whether or not the memory cell ( mc2 ) 75 passes a current . here , the signal ssa is set at the high level , and thus the binary data of a high / low state is set to the voltages vsa and vsa -- output from the sense amplifier 80 , in accordance with the memory cell mc1 . as explained above , according to the present embodiment , it is possible to adopt a folded bit line system without the use of a dummy cell even if the memory cell ( mc1 ) 74 connected to the bit line ( bl ) 71 and the memory cell ( mc2 ) 75 connected to the inverted bit line ( bl -- ) 72 are connected to one word line ( wl ) 73 . as a result , the layout design becomes easy . also , various noise act in exactly the same way on the bit line ( bl ) 71 and the inverted bit line ( bl -- ) 72 . therefore , the influence of the noise can be suppressed to the lowest level . accordingly , it is possible to raise the sensitivity of the sense amplifier 80 and to achieve an enhancement of speed . note that , in the present embodiment , the current of the memory cell ( mc2 ) 75 can be completely compensated from the first voltage v p1 , but the above - described circuit can be constituted so far as { the current of memory cell mc1 & gt ; ( the current of the memory cell mc2 -- the current compensated from the first voltage v p1 )} stands while considering variations etc . also , the circuit according to the present embodiment can be applied to both nand type and nor type of the flash memory . fig5 is a circuit diagram showing a second embodiment of the semiconductor nonvolatile memory device according to the present invention . in the present circuit , in a nand type flash memory , two upper selective transistors are provided , one being made to act as a depletion transistor , whereby it is possible to adopt the folded bit line system . unlike the first embodiment , a dummy cell is used as a reference cell . also , this circuit has the same structure as that of the folded bit line of the well known dram circuit except the selective gate of each memory cell array is constituted by two stages . in fig5 saf denotes a flip - flop type sense amplifier 119 ( in the same way as fig3 ); bl denotes a bit line 100 ; bl -- denotes an inverted bit line 101 ; mca 1h and mca 2h denote the memory cell arrays 107 and 102 connected to the bit line ( bl ) 100 ; mca 1 λ and mca 2 λ are memory cell arrays 108 and 103 connected to the inverted bit line ( bl -- ) 101 ; dcl h denotes a dummy cell 95 connected to the bit line ( bl ) 100 ; dcl . sub . λ denotes a dummy cell 96 connected to the inverted bit line ( bl -- ) 101 ; d denotes a data line 126 ; d -- denotes an inverted data line 125 taking a complementary level to that of the data line ; and nt 11 to nt 16 denote nmos transistors 93 , 94 , 116 , 117 , 123 and 124 ; respectively . fig6 a and 6b are views showing an example of the structure of the memory cell array according to the present embodiment . as shown in ( fig6 a ), each memory cell array is constituted by upper first and second selective transistors ( sl 1 ) 133 and ( sl 2 ) 135 connected in series ; eight memory transistors ( mt 0 to mt 7 ) 137 , 139 , . . . , 142 connected in series to the second selective transistor ( sl 2 ) 135 ; and a lower selective transistor ( sl 3 ) 144 connected in series between the memory transistor ( mt 7 ) 142 and the ground . one of the first and second selective transistors ( sl 1 ) 133 and ( sl 2 ) 135 is constituted by a depletion transistor . in the memory cell array , the first selective transistor ( sl 1 ) 133 is connected to the bit line ( bl ) 100 or the inverted bit line ( bl -- ) 101 . at this time , the first and second selective transistors ( sl 1 ) 133 and ( sl 2 ) 135 of the memory cell array connected to the same bit line ( bl ) 100 or inverted bit line ( bl -- ) 101 are alternately constituted by the depletion transistor in an order of connection from the side of the sense amplifier sa f . note that , in fig5 the structure of fig6 a is expressed by simplifying the same like fig6 b . an explanation will be made next of the operation by the above - described structure taking as an example a case where the data of the memory transistor connected to the selective gates indicated by ( sg 11 ) 113 and ( sg 21 ) 112 in fig5 and connected to the word line wlj is read out . note that , the explanation for the writing / erasing operation is omitted here . first , as the initial state , the signals pc ( 92 ), sag ( 115 ), and yi ( 122 ) are set at the low level ( 0v ). by this , the nmos transistors ( nt 11 to nt 16 ) 93 , 94 , 116 , 117 , 123 , and 124 become the off state . further , the signals dsg and sg are set at the low level and the word line wlj and dummy word line ( dwl ) 97 are set at the high level ( 5v ). also , the vsal ( 118 ) and vsah ( 121 ) are set at the voltage v pc ( 91 ), and the data line ( d ) 126 and inverted data line ( d -- ) 125 are set at ( 1 / 2 ) v cc level . in this state , the signals pc ( 92 ) and sag ( 115 ) are set at the high level . by this , the nmos transistors ( nt 11 to nt 14 ) 93 , 94 , 116 , and 117 become the on state . as a result , the bit line ( bl ) 100 and inverted bit line ( bl -- ) 101 are precharged to the voltage v pc ( 91 ). next , the word line of the almost simultaneously selected cell is set at the low level , and the signal sg is set at the high level . the signal dsg of the dummy cell dmc connected to the inverted bit line ( bl -- ) 101 is set at the high level and the dummy word line ( dwl ) 97 is set at the low level . in this case , the signals sg 2 ( 110 ) and dsg 1 ( 99 ) are set at the high level , and the word line ( wl ) 109 and dummy word line ( dwl ) 97 are set at the low level . when the precharge is ended , the signal pc ( 92 ) is set at the low level . by this , the nmos transistors ( nt 11 and nt 12 ) 93 and 94 become the off state , and the sensing is started . when the selected cell passes a current , the voltage v bl of the bit line ( bl ) 100 is lowered . this is not changed if it does not pass a current . on the other hand , since the dummy cell dmc is set so as to pass a current at an intermediate level , the voltage v bl -- of the inverted bit line ( bl -- ) 101 is slightly lowered . namely , when assuming that the selected cell passes a current , the voltage v bl of the bit line ( bl ) 100 is considerably lowered . when the potential difference between the bit line ( bl ) 100 and the inverted bit line ( bl -- ) 101 becomes around - 0 . 1v , the signals sag ( 115 ) and vsal ( 118 ) are set to the low level and vsah ( 121 ) is set to the high level . by this , looking the outputs sa and sa -- of the sense amplifier sa f , the voltage sa becomes the low level ( 0v ) and the voltage sa -- becomes the high level ( 5v ) due to the operation of the flipflop - type sense amplifier sa f . next , the signal yi ( 122 ) is set to the high level . by this , the nmos transistors ( nt 15 and nt 16 ) 123 and 124 become the on state and the voltages sa and sa -- are read out to the data line ( d ) 126 and the inverted data line ( d -- ) 125 . as explained above , according to the present embodiment , two selective transistors are used in each memory cell array and one selective transistor is made a depletion transistor , so it is possible to adopt a folded bit line system even in a nand type flash memory . as a result , the layout is easy to set . also , various noise act in exactly the same way on the bit line ( bl ) 100 and the inverted bit line ( bl -- ) 101 . therefore , the influence of the noise can be suppressed to the lowest level . accordingly , it is possible to raise the sensitivity of the sense amplifier and to achieve an enhancement of speed . further , the cell size can be made smaller than a nor type and the manufacturing process becomes simple as well . also , with a 3v single power source , it is possible to make the cell about 100 ns . note that in the second embodiment , nand type flash memory was explained as an example , but the present invention may also be applied to nor type flash memory . as explained above , according to this embodiment , it is possible to adopt a folded bit line system even in a flash memory or other semiconductor nonvolatile memory device . as a result , the layout becomes easy and , further , various noise act in exactly the same way on the first and second bit lines , so the influence of noise can be suppressed to the lowest level . accordingly , the sensitivity of the sense amplifier can be raised , and the enhancement of speed can be achieved .'
